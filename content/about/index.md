A lifelong learner, builder, and someone who enjoys making sense of complex things.

This space is a home for my thoughts-in-progress: whether it’s something I’m building, a topic I’m digging into, or an idea I haven’t quite figured out yet. I believe in learning out loud and sharing what I discover along the way.

Outside of this blog, I spend my time coding / reading / teaching tech / tinkering / exploring ideas, and I'm always up for a good conversation.

Welcome again, and I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity.
	
I am a seasoned Software Engineer and Technical Manager with a passion to learn new skills both technical and [non-technical](https://500px.com/p/ArshadSiddiqui)!
