## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C / 160°C Fan / Gas Mark 4. Grease and line three 20cm sandwich tins with baking parchment.  
2. Dry fry the walnut halves in a frying pan over medium heat for 5 minutes until aromatic. Set aside to cool.  
3. Beat butter and sugar with an electric whisk until light and creamy. Beat in eggs one at a time. If mixture splits, add a tablespoon of flour and continue mixing.  
4. Fold dissolved coffee into the wet mix.  
5. In a food processor, blitz the flour, baking powder, and cooled walnuts until the nuts are finely ground.  
6. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture using a silicone spatula, ensuring flour at the bottom is incorporated.  
7. Divide the mixture evenly among the three tins. Smooth the tops with an offset palette knife.  
8. Bake for 23-28 minutes until a cocktail stick inserted comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool in tins briefly before transferring to wire racks.  
9. For the coffee buttercream icing: beat butter until soft, gradually add icing sugar, then mix in dissolved coffee. Add milk if needed to loosen the icing.  
10. Once sponges are cool, level any domed tops with a bread knife.  
11. Assemble the cake by spreading 1/3 of the buttercream on the first sponge layer, then add the second sponge and repeat. Place the top sponge upside down, pressing gently.  
12. Spread remaining icing on the top and decorate with walnut halves.
