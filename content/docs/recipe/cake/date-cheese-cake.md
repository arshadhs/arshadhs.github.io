## Recipe

1. Lightly grease a 23cm (9 inch) loose-bottomed round cake tin. Line the sides with a strip of baking parchment, folding and snipping the bottom edge so it fits neatly. Place a parchment circle on the base.
2. Preheat the oven to **160°C**.
3. Crush the digestive biscuits in a bag using a rolling pin. Melt the butter in a pan, add crushed biscuits and demerara sugar. Mix well and press firmly into the tin base. Let it set in a cool place.
4. In a bowl, beat the softened butter, caster sugar, cream cheese, flour, lemon rind and juice, and egg yolks until smooth.
5. Fold in the lightly whipped cream.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk egg whites until stiff (but not dry) and fold gently into the cheese mixture.
7. Pour the filling over the biscuit base and level the surface.
8. Halve and deseed the dates. Gently press them into the top of the filling.
9. Bake for **1 to 1¼ hours** until just set.
10. Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside for another **1 hour**.
11. Loosen edges with a knife, then remove the cake from the tin and place on a serving plate.
12. Optional: Spread whipped cream on top and decorate with dates. Dust lightly with icing sugar if desired.
