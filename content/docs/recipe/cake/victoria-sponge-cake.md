## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to **180°C (160°C Fan)**.  
2. Grease and line **two 20cm/8in sandwich tins**. Lightly coat the sides and base with butter, then line the base with baking paper.  
3. In a large bowl, add **eggs, sugar, flour, baking powder, and butter**.  
4. Mix until just combined using an electric hand mixer or a wooden spoon. Do not overmix. The batter should drop off a spoon easily.  
5. Divide the mixture evenly between the prepared tins.  
6. Bake on the middle shelf for **25 minutes** (check at 20 minutes) until golden and springy to the touch.  
7. Allow the cakes to cool in the tins for a few minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.  
8. To assemble:  
   - Place one sponge layer upside down on a serving plate.  
   - Spread generously with jam and whipped cream if using.  
   - Place the second sponge on top, right side up.  
   - Dust the top with caster sugar before serving.
