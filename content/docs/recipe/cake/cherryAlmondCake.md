Cherry and Almond Cake is one of my all-time favourites — a dependable classic that never disappoints. It’s soft and moist on the inside, with a thin golden crust and a beautiful balance of sweet cherries and nutty almond flavour. Always a hit with family and friends!

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to **140°C fan** (160°C conventional).  
2. Line the base of a **20cm deep round cake tin** with baking paper and grease the sides with butter.  
3. Rinse the glacé cherries thoroughly, pat dry, halve them, and toss them in a little flour to prevent sinking.  
4. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.  
5. Add almond extract.  
6. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed until just incorporated.  
7. Gently fold in the flour, baking powder, and ground almonds.  
8. Add **half of the cherries** to the batter at this stage (optional), and stir in the milk to loosen the mixture.  
9. Pour the batter into the prepared tin.  
10. Arrange the **remaining cherries on top**, then scatter over the flaked almonds.  
11. Bake for **45 minutes**, checking after 30–35 minutes. If needed, bake an additional 5–10 minutes until a skewer comes out clean.  
12. Let the cake cool in the tin for 10 minutes on a wire rack before removing.
