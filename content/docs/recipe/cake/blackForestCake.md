### Recipe

1. Grease and line a 9” cake tin with parchment paper.  
2. Preheat oven to 180°C.  
3. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt. Set aside.  
4. Beat egg whites until fluffy (using a stand mixer is recommended).  
5. When soft peaks form, gradually add the sugar. Beat until glossy.  
6. Add egg yolks and vanilla extract, and beat well.  
7. Gradually add oil and continue beating for 1–2 minutes.  
8. Gently fold in the dry ingredients using a spatula.  
9. Pour batter into the lined cake tin. Tap the tin to release air bubbles.  
10. Bake at 180°C for about 25 minutes. To check doneness, insert a fork; it should come out clean.  
11. Allow the cake to cool while preparing the syrup.  
12. For the syrup: combine sugar and water in a pan on medium heat. Boil until sugar dissolves (about 5 minutes). Set aside.  
13. Whip the cream with powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.  
14. Remove cake from tin and slice horizontally into two layers.  
15. Soak cake layers with the sugar syrup.  
16. Spread one-third of the whipped cream on the first layer.  
17. Place the second cake layer on top. Cover with remaining whipped cream.  
18. Decorate with canned cherries on top.
