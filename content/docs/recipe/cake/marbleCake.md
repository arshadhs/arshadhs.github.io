## Ingredients

- 250g plain flour  
- 200g unsalted butter (softened)  
- 200g caster sugar

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).  
2. Line a 1kg loaf tin with baking parchment.  
3. In a large bowl, beat the butter, 180g of the sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy.  
4. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.  
5. Add the baking powder and sift in the flour.  
6. Fold the flour in gently with 2 tbsp of the milk.  
7. Spoon two-thirds of the mixture into the loaf tin (should fill about three-quarters of the tin).  
8. To the remaining third, sift in the cocoa powder and add the remaining milk and 20g of sugar. Mix well.  
9. Spoon the chocolate mixture over the plain one in the tin.  
10. Swirl a fork gently through both mixtures to create a marbled effect—avoid overmixing.  
11. Bake for 55–70 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean (check from 55 minutes).  
12. Remove the cake from the tin and let it cool on a wire rack.  
13. Once cooled, dust with icing sugar before serving.
