- Red food colouring (liquid) – 2 tbsp

- Cream cheese – 227g  
- Mascarpone cheese – 227g  
- Vanilla extract – 1 tsp  
- Icing sugar (sifted) – 115g  
- Whipping cream (double cream, cold) – 360 ml  

### Method

#### Cake

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease two 9-inch round cake tins and line the bottoms with parchment paper.  
2. In a bowl, sift together flour, salt, and cocoa powder. Set aside.  
3. In a mixer, beat butter and sugar on medium until light and fluffy. Add vanilla.  
4. Add eggs one at a time, mixing just until incorporated.  
5. Whisk buttermilk with red food colouring.  
6. Alternately add flour mixture and buttermilk to the batter, starting and ending with flour.  
7. Mix vinegar and baking soda in a small cup, let it fizz, then fold into the batter.  
8. Divide the batter between tins, smooth tops, and bake for 25–30 minutes.  
9. Cool in tins for 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.  
10. Wrap cooled cakes in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or overnight) before frosting.

#### Cream Cheese Frosting

1. Beat cream cheese and mascarpone until smooth.  
2. Add vanilla and icing sugar, beat until well combined.  
3. Switch to a whisk attachment and slowly add cold whipping cream.  
4. Whip until thick and spreadable. Adjust cream or sugar as needed.

### Assembly

1. Optionally slice each cake in half horizontally to create four layers.  
2. Place one layer (top side down) on a serving plate and spread with frosting.  
3. Continue layering and frosting.  
4. Cover top and sides with remaining frosting. Chill before serving if desired.
