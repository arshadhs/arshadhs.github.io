## Chicken Tikka Masala

Chicken tikka masala stimulates the senses; the mildly spiced masala coating tender pieces of marinated, char-grilled chicken is one of Britain’s favourite takeaways.

Although it is claimed the dish was created in Glasgow, it certainly has Indian influences. There is no standard recipe for chicken tikka masala; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. I found Madhur Jaffrey’s *Curry Nation* to be the most interesting for my taste buds. Her recipe of marinating chicken in whipping cream ends up flawlessly moist, thanks to her grilling technique. No one can beat Jaffrey’s DIY answer to the fiery tandoor—it gives the chicken an intense charcoal flavour.

## Cooking the Chicken

1. Preheat grill to highest setting.  
2. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers.  
3. Suspend skewers over a dish/tray and grill 5 minutes each side until charred and cooked through.  
4. Alternatively, place oiled chicken on a baking tray and grill 5 minutes per side.  

**Tip:** Cut into the thickest piece to ensure it’s fully cooked — no pink should remain.
