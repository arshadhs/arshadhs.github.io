Also called **Kasher Czot**, **Kashmiri Czot**, or **Kandur Czot**, this humble bread is a quiet pillar of Kashmiri life.

A Kashmiri’s day is incomplete without *czot* — the warm, lightly chewy flatbread that graces every breakfast table, often with a simple spread of butter or jam. This medium-sized everyday bread is crafted by the **kandur**, the local baker, who prepares it fresh each morning in a **tandoor** (hot clay oven). With swift skill, he presses finger impressions into each round of dough before gently placing it against the inner walls of the glowing oven. 

The result? A bread that’s golden on the top, soft and white beneath, crisp at the edges, tender inside. The artisan *kandurs* of the valley have nourished their communities for generations, kneading with care, letting dough rise with patience, and stoking the fire that feeds entire neighbourhoods.
