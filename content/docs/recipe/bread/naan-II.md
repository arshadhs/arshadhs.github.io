## Recipe

### Dough preparation

1. Mix salt, sugar, and yeast into lukewarm water.  
2. Leave the mixture in a warm place for 5-15 minutes to activate the yeast (timing depends on room temperature).  
3. Combine baking soda with the plain flour and mix well.  
4. Add oil and yoghurt to the flour mixture.  
5. Add the yeast water gradually and mix to form a soft dough — don’t overwork it.  
6. Place the dough in a large bowl and cover with cling film.  
7. Let it rise for 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on the temperature.  

### Baking

1. Preheat your oven to 220°C (or equivalent) and leave the baking tray inside for 20 minutes to heat.  
2. Divide the dough into 6 equal balls.  
3. Roll each ball out into a round or teardrop shape.  
4. Optionally, sprinkle sesame seeds on top and gently press them in.  
5. Place the naans on the hot baking tray and bake for 3-5 minutes, turning halfway through, until puffed and golden.  
6. Remove from the oven and brush hot naans with butter immediately.
