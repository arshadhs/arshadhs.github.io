**Harissa** is a very popular meat preparation, traditionally made for breakfast.  
It is slow-cooked for hours with warming spices — and yes, stirred by hand for a very long time. With the sharp dip in temperatures, Harissa becomes the most sought-after delicacy during winters in **Srinagar**.

## History

It is said that the concept of Harissa was brought to Kashmir by *Mirza Hyder Duglat* of Yarkand during the Chak period in 1540.  
Some historians trace its origins to Central Asia, which greatly influenced Kashmiri art, custom, rituals, belief, and cuisine — blessing the region with this flavoursome delight.

Its roots also stretch back to the Mughal era. During Afghan rule in Kashmir, Harissa was formally introduced in its present form.  
Back then, economic conditions were so dire that many substituted boiled turnips — a cheaper alternative — for Harissa.  
Eventually, shops opened in *Aali Kadal* and *Saraf Kadal* in *Shahar-e-Khaas*, with the former becoming particularly famous for adding milk to the dish.  
Harissa slowly became a cherished cultural food, often gifted to celebrate snowfall predictions!

## Method

1. In a pressure cooker, add the lamb, garlic, onion, ginger powder, salt, and water.  
2. Place all whole spices in a muslin cloth and tie to form a *potli*. Add this potli to the cooker.  
3. Cook on medium-high heat. After 2 whistles, reduce heat and let simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  
4. Turn off heat and let the pressure release naturally.  
5. Open the lid, stir with a wooden spoon until the meat and onions have blended into a uniform mixture.  
6. Remove any bones and discard the spice potli.  

### To thicken:

7. Mix rice flour with **cold** water to form a smooth paste.  
8. Return the cooker to the stove and stir in the rice paste.  
9. Add oil gradually and keep stirring every 2 minutes over medium-high heat.  
10. Continue until the mixture thickens and oil begins to leave the sides (this may take another 45 minutes to 1 hour).

## Garnish

1. Slice shallots thinly and fry in hot oil until golden and crispy.  
   Be careful not to burn or break them.  
2. Serve the Harissa hot, topped with crunchy fried shallots **and the oil**.  
3. Traditionally served with **Kashmiri bread**.

**Note:**  
- Cut the meat very small so it requires less stirring.  
- When reheating, if the Harissa has thickened too much, stir in a few tablespoons of milk to loosen the texture.
