## Recipe

1. **Marinate the Meat:**  
   Clean and deseed papaya, make a paste. Mix papaya paste into minced meat and marinate for 2 hours.

2. **Prepare Roasted Chickpea Flour:**  
   Dry roast besan in a pan gently until aromatic. Do not burn.

3. **Prepare Galawat Masala:**  
   Dry roast the listed spices until aromatic. Let them cool, then grind to a fine powder.

4. **Sauté Onions:**  
   Finely chop onions and sauté in 3 tbsp ghee until golden brown. Let cool and grind with ginger garlic paste to a smooth paste.

5. **Mix Marinade:**  
   In a large bowl, combine marinated meat with:
   - Roasted spice powder  
   - Onion-garlic paste  
   - Roasted chickpea flour  
   - Red chilli powder  
   - Saffron milk  
   - Rose water and kewra water  
   - Milk powder and salt  

6. **Rest:**  
   Mix thoroughly, cover with cling film, and refrigerate for 4–5 hours.

7. **Dum (Smoking):**  
   Heat a small piece of coal until red hot. Place it in a small metal bowl and position the bowl in the centre of the marinated meat.  
   Add ghee, cloves, and green cardamom over the coal. Quickly cover the container tightly to trap the smoke. Let rest for 15–20 minutes.

8. **Shape & Fry:**  
   Shape the meat into small flat patties.  
   Heat 2 tbsp ghee in a pan and shallow fry kebabs on low flame until cooked and browned on both sides.
