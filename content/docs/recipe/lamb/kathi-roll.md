## Ingredients

### For the Lamb Marinade
- Lamb - 500 grams (boneless, cut into cubes)  
- Lime juice - 2 tablespoons  
- Chilli flakes - 1 teaspoon  
- Garam masala - 1/2 teaspoon  
- Ground cumin - 1/2 teaspoon  
- Ground black pepper - 1/4 teaspoon  
- Salt - 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste)  
- Oil - 2 tablespoons  

### Wrap
- Parathas, chapatti or other flatbread - 6  
- Eggs - 6 large  
- Coriander - 2 tablespoons (chopped)  
- Vegetable oil - 2 tablespoons  

### Salad
- Red onions - 2 (halved and very thinly sliced)  
- Green chillies - 2 (finely chopped)  
- White vinegar or lime juice - 3-4 tablespoons  
- Salt - 1/2 teaspoon (or to taste)  
- Coriander - 2 tablespoons (chopped)  

## Recipe

Rinse the meat in cold water. Add the rest of the marinade ingredients and mix well. Set aside in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight to marinate.  

For the salad, mix the onions in a bowl with chillies, vinegar/lime juice, coriander, and salt. Set aside.  

Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl with chopped coriander.  

Heat a frying pan over medium heat, then add a flatbread. Cook for 30 seconds. Drizzle 1 teaspoon oil around the edge and let it run under the pan.  

Pour one-sixth of the egg mixture on top of the bread and spread it around. Using a spatula, quickly flip the bread over so the egg is underneath (most of the egg will fall off the bread into the pan). Cook for 1-2 minutes, pressing down gently with a spatula, until the egg sets. Flip the bread over and brown the other side for 30 seconds.  

Repeat with the remaining bread and eggs. Wrap in foil and keep warm in the oven.  

Heat a griddle pan, grill or barbecue to very hot. Drain the beef of its marinade, pat dry with kitchen paper, and thread onto skewers. Drizzle the kebabs with the 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and cook for 3â€“4 minutes or until lightly charred in places but still pink in the middle. Remove the meat from the skewers to a warm plate.  

To serve, put the warm wraps egg-side up on plates and arrange the meat down the middle of each.  

Drain the onion and chillies of the vinegar or lime juice, then toss with the chopped coriander. Scatter the salad over the meat, then roll up the wrap and serve.
