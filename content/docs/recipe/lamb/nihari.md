# Nihari

**Nihari** (Urdu: نهاری‎) is a rich, slow-cooked meat stew made from lamb or beef shanks and often enhanced with bone marrow. Traditionally eaten after Fajr prayers, its name comes from the Arabic word *"Nahar"* (نهار) meaning "day."

The dish simmers overnight in large vessels known as *shab deg*—resulting in intensely deep flavours and melt-in-the-mouth meat. Though chicken versions exist, **beef shanks** or **lamb leg** bring out the best texture and taste.

Enjoyed especially in winters, Nihari is best served with khameeri roti, naan, or phulka, garnished generously with ginger, green chillies, and lemon.
