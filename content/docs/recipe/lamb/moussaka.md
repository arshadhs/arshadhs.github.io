# Moussaka

A good moussaka is a joy to behold — cinnamon-spiced lamb mingling with aubergines and topped with a delicious creamy béchamel-style sauce.

Moussaka is an eggplant- or potato-based dish, often including ground meat, with regional variations found across countries of the former Ottoman Empire.

- In **Turkey**, it's sautéed and served warm or at room temperature.  
- In **Arabic countries**, it's often eaten cold.  
- In the **Balkans**, it's layered and served hot, with a top layer of creamy custard or béchamel.
