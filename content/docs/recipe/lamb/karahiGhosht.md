## Recipe

1. Dry roast cumin seeds, coriander seeds, dried red chillies, and black pepper in a pan until fragrant.  
2. Add dried fenugreek and grind the mixture into a fine powder.  
3. Heat oil (and butter or ghee if using) in a pan. Add ginger and garlic paste, stir for a few seconds.  
4. Add the lamb meat and fry on high heat until it changes colour slightly.  
5. Remove the meat and keep it covered in a bowl.  
6. In the same pan, add the diced onions and fry until golden.  
7. Add chopped tomatoes, salt, Kashmiri chilli powder, and the ground spice mix (except garam masala).  
8. Lower the heat and cook the tomato-onion mixture until oil separates from the sides.  
9. Whisk the yoghurt and gradually mix it into the pan until fully incorporated.  
10. Return the meat to the pan, stir well, and add about 1 cup of warm water.  
11. Cover and simmer on low heat until the meat is tender.  
    - Using a pressure cooker: about 20-30 minutes  
    - Without pressure cooker: 1 hour or more  
12. Add more warm water as needed to keep a gravy consistency.  
13. Once cooked, adjust salt to taste. Sprinkle garam masala, slit green chilli, and chopped coriander.  
14. Stir, turn off heat, and serve hot.
