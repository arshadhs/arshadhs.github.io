Lagan Seekh is a delicious one-pot minced meat dish where flavorful marinated meat is baked with egg layers and topped with crispy fried onions (birasta). Itâ€™s a simple yet satisfying recipe perfect for a hearty meal.

## Ingredients

- 250 g mincemeat  
- 1 tsp butter or 1 tsp oil  
- 1 onion  
- 1 tbsp garlic paste  
- 1 tbsp finely chopped green chillies  
- 1 tbsp finely chopped coriander leaves  
- 1 tbsp finely chopped mint leaves  
- 1 egg  
- Salt to taste  
- Pepper powder  

## Recipe

Put garlic paste, coriander leaves, mint leaves, and salt on top of the mincemeat and mix it well.  
Marinate for an hour.  

Cut the onion and deep fry it in oil.  
As soon as it turns golden, remove it from oil and keep it aside. This is known as birasta.  

Beat the egg with pepper powder and salt.  

Take a flat pan and grease it with butter or oil. Spread about half the quantity of the beaten egg on the pan.  

Mix half the birasta and the marinated mincemeat dough. Press lightly to spread throughout the pan.  

Spread the remaining beaten egg over the dough.  

Cover the pan with foil and bake in the oven or on the gas for 25 minutes.  

Garnish with birasta, capsicum, tomato, and carrot before serving.
