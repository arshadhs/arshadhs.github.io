Maqluba (مَقْلُوبَة literally "upside-down" in Arabic) is a stunning, layered rice dish with chicken, vegetables, and fragrant spices. 

Maqluba is distinct from *Kabsa* and *Mandi* — while Kabsa is spiced rice often cooked with tomato and dried lime, and Mandi is traditionally cooked in a tandoor-style oven for a smoky flavour, Maqluba is layered and flipped upside down for a beautiful, structured presentation.

## Assembly

1. Cut parchment paper to fit the bottom of your pot.  
2. Lay tomato slices over the paper.  
3. Layer in this order:
   - Chicken  
   - Potato slices (if using)  
   - Rice  
4. Pour **hot broth** over the rice (not warm or cold).  
5. Add:
   - Fried pine nuts and almonds  
   - A spoonful of ghee  
6. Cover with a lid and boil on medium-high.  
7. Once boiling, reduce heat and cook until rice is fluffy (15–25 minutes).

## To Flip Maqluba

- Let it rest for **at least 10 minutes** before flipping.  
- Place a large plate over the pot.  
- Flip confidently and serve!

## Notes

- **Parchment paper** prevents sticking and makes flipping easier.  
- **Taste your broth** before adding to rice — if salty, replace 2 cups with plain water.  
- **Presentation matters** — the layered effect is part of the magic of Maqluba!
