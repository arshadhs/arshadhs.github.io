## Recipe

Wash the rice and soak in warm water for 20 minutes.  
Cook the rice till almost done, then drain and keep aside.  

In a large bowl, mix the minced lamb or chicken with 2 of the chopped onions, 2 tbsp garlic paste, 1 tbsp ginger paste, 2 tbsp garam masala, tomato ketchup, coriander leaves, and salt.  
Form the mixture into equal-sized meatballs and set aside on a plate.  

Heat oil in a pan and fry the sliced onion until crispy and golden. Drain on paper towels and keep aside for garnish.  

In the same oil, add 1 finely chopped onion and fry until light brown.  
Add ginger and garlic pastes, frying for a minute.  

Add coriander, cumin, chilli powder, garam masala, and turmeric, and fry for 2–3 minutes.  
Add tomatoes and cook until the oil separates from the masala.  

Add 1 cup of warm water and season with salt.  
Gently add the meatballs without stirring for 5 minutes.  
Then stir gently to avoid breaking the meatballs.  

Cook uncovered until the meatballs are fully cooked and the gravy is reduced to about 1 to 1½ cups.  

Soak the saffron strands in 2–3 tbsp warm milk.  

Grease a large, deep ovenproof dish lightly with cooking oil.  
Layer the rice and koftas as follows: rice - koftas - rice.  

Drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the top layer of rice.  
Garnish with crispy fried onions and chopped coriander leaves.  

Cover the dish and seal tightly.  
Bake in a hot oven for 30 minutes.  

Serve hot with raita and a fresh green salad of your choice.
