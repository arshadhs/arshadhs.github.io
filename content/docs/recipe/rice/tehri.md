Tehri was a Sunday lunch in childhood. 'Tehri' is yellow rice with potato and peas.  
I had a different version with meat once at a friend’s place and have not forgotten the taste yet.  
So a while back when my taste buds asked for it, I was on the phone with my friend and asked his mum for the recipe — thanks to her for sharing it.

## Ingredients

- Lamb, cut into pieces – ½ kg  
- Onion (chopped) – 1 large  
- Ginger (paste) – 1 tablespoon  
- Garlic (crushed) – 4 cloves  
- Turmeric powder (Haldi) – 2 teaspoons  
- Chilli powder – 1 teaspoon  
- Coriander powder (Dhania) – 1 teaspoon  
- Bay leaves – 2  
- Cumin seeds (Zeera) – ½ teaspoon  
- Garam masala – 1½ teaspoons (alternatively use crushed: cloves 2, black pepper 5, green cardamom 1 and black cardamom 1)  
- Salt – to taste  
- Oil – 3 tablespoons  

- Potato (cut into quarters) – 2 large  
- Green chilli (halved) – 2  
- Green peas – 1 bowl  
- Rice (Basmati) – ½ kg  
- Water – as needed  

## Recipe

1. Add 3 tablespoons of oil to a pressure cooker.  
2. Once hot, add onions and fry until golden brown.  
3. Add ginger and garlic; stir for a few minutes.  
4. Add lamb meat and salt; cook until the meat turns medium brown.  
5. Add turmeric powder, chilli powder, and coriander powder; stir until oil separates.  
6. Add bay leaves and cumin seeds; cook for another minute.  
7. Add garam masala and stir for 30 seconds.  
8. Add ½ cup water and close the pressure cooker lid.  
9. Cook until the meat is tender.  
10. Open the lid and add potatoes and green peas; cook for 2 minutes.  
11. Add rice, green chillies, and sufficient water.  
12. Check salt and adjust as needed.  
13. Cover with a heavy lid to retain steam.  
14. Cook on low heat for about 15–20 minutes.
