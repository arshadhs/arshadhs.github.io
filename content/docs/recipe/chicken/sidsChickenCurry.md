Most of what I see is forgotten.  
Most of what I think never makes it out of my head.  
Most of what I say disappears into the air not long after I say it.

"Silence is golden"—but sometimes, a few of those thoughts or words might be worth capturing. Like that half-written recipe or a fleeting idea. Maybe it’ll help someone out there. Maybe it'll help me when I stumble across it again.

So here’s one of those recipes. A bit of a throwback to 2007–2008, when I was on a strict self-designed diet. I’d eat this dish about four times a week. It was clean, protein-packed, low-fat, and gave me just enough energy for my early morning runs and evening gym sessions.

Back then, I barely knew how to cook chicken. So I experimented—trial and error, tweaks and retweaks—until this recipe came to life. It's not revolutionary, but it's mine. Familiar, yet personal. Simple, yet satisfying.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg chicken breast (or a whole chicken, if you prefer)
- ½ kg onions
- 5 cloves garlic (grated)
- 2 tbsp fresh ginger (grated)
- 400 g plain curd (yoghurt)
- Salt to taste
- 5 tbsp olive oil (or sunflower/vegetable oil)

**Whole Spices**  
- 2 bay leaves  
- 1 stick cinnamon  
- 4 green cardamoms  
- 3 black cardamoms  
- 4 cloves  
- 6 black peppercorns  
- 3 pinches nutmeg  
- 2 strands mace  

**Ground Spices**  
- 1 tsp red chilli powder  
- 2 tsp coriander powder  
- ⅔ tsp garam masala  
- ½ tsp turmeric powder  

## Method

1. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pot. *(Don’t overheat it—olive oil prefers it gentle.)*
2. Add the whole spices and let them release their aroma.
3. Add chicken, ginger, garlic, and salt. Sauté until the chicken turns white on all sides.
4. Remove the chicken and set aside.
5. Remove the whole spices from the oil and keep them aside too.
6. Add the ground spices and curd to the chicken, and let it marinate for at least an hour.
7. Meanwhile, in the same pot, fry the onions until golden.
8. Add the whole spices back in. Top up the oil if needed.
9. Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat with the lid on for 15–20 minutes, or until done.

**PS**  
- For a twist, try using tomato purée, *sarson ka saag* (mustard greens), or spinach instead of curd.  
- Sometimes I’d cheat and use *Shana* masala—nothing wrong with shortcuts.  
- Want it spicy? Toss in 2–3 green chillies and dial down the red chilli and garam masala to balance.  
- Garnish with fresh green coriander and serve it up hot.

This one’s close to my heart. Hope it finds a place in your kitchen too.
