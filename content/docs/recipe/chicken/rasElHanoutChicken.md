Ras el Hanout! رَأْسُ الحانُوتِ (raʾsu al-ḥānūti) literally means: 
- "head" or "top" — رَأْس (raʾs)
- "the shop" — الحانُوت (al-ḥānūt)

So رَأْسُ الحانُوتِ translates to "head of the shop", and figuratively it means "the best (or top) of what the shop has to offer" — usually referring to a premium spice mix made by spice vendors in the Maghreb (especially Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). It’s used in Moroccan tagines, grilled meats, rice dishes, and even some desserts. Each vendor often has their own unique recipe, which can include dozens of spices

On my trip to Morocco, I bought **Ras el Hanout** spice mix — I'd heard quite a lot about it, but buying it in **Marrakech** had its own charm. I tasted several dishes made with Ras el Hanout at our hotel. A few weeks later, our office kitchen chef made *poached white fish in Ras el Hanout*, and that’s what inspired me to try my own version — this lovely **Chicken in Ras el Hanout**.
