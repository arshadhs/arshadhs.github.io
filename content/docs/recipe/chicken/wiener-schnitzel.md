## Ingredients

- **Chicken breast (escalopes)** – 1 kg  
- **Eggs** – 2  
- **Double cream** – 2 tbsp  
- **Flour** – to coat  
- **White breadcrumbs (dried)** – 50 g

## Recipe

1. Place chicken escalopes between two sheets of plastic wrap and flatten with a rolling pin until very thin, being careful not to tear the meat.  
2. Season both sides with salt and pepper.  
3. In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the cream.  
4. Place flour on one plate and breadcrumbs on another.  
5. Dip each escalope first in the flour, then the egg mixture, and finally in breadcrumbs. Do not press too hard into the breadcrumbs.  
6. Place the coated cutlets on a plate and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.  
7. Heat oil in a wide frying pan over medium-high heat until a breadcrumb sizzles and browns quickly.  
8. Add clarified butter or ghee. When foaming, add the schnitzels.  
9. Fry until golden on the bottom, swirling the pan to cascade the oil over the top.  
10. Turn and cook the other side until golden brown.  
11. Remove and blot with kitchen paper. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
