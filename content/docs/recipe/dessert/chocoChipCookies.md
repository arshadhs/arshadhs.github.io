## Method

1. Whisk together the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and softened butter until creamy.  
2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla extract until combined.  
3. Add the plain flour, baking soda, and cocoa powder. Mix gently with a spatula.  
4. Fold in the white and dark chocolate chunks.  
5. Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight for better flavour.  
6. Preheat the oven to 180°C.  
7. Use an ice cream scoop to portion out the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this prevents burning the bottoms).  
8. Bake for about 10 minutes, or until the edges start to brown—avoid overbaking to keep them chewy.
