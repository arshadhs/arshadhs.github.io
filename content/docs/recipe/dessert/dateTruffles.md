## Recipe

1. Place all ingredients in a food processor and pulse until a sticky paste forms.  
   *(Add a teaspoon of water if the mixture is too stiff.)*  
2. Scoop small amounts and roll into small balls using your hands.  
3. Place the truffles in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm up.  
4. Roll the truffles lightly in cocoa powder before serving.  

**Note:** Be cautious with the cocoa powder — too much can make them bitter (lesson learned!).

Perfect for a quick Iftaar treat, or as a sweet bite any time of the day during Ramadan.
