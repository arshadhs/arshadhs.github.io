# Kunafa

Kunafa (also spelled knafeh, kunafeh, kunafeh, knafeh, or kunafah) is a Mediterranean cheese pastry soaked in sweet sugar-based syrup, typical of the regions belonging to the former Ottoman Empire. It is especially popular during Ramadan.

Naboulsi or akawi cheese is traditionally layered between crispy thin Kataifi pastry dough. This recipe uses vermicelli as a substitute for kataifi and ricotta with mozzarella in place of the cheeses. The flavoured sugar syrup and crunchy nuts finish this delicious dessert.

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas mark 4.  
2. Grease and line an 8-inch sandwich tin with baking paper, coating sides and base lightly with butter or baking spread.  
3. Break vermicelli into small pieces and roast in butter. Add 2 tablespoons of water if needed to soften, but avoid mushiness.  
4. Spread half of the vermicelli evenly in the baking dish and press down lightly.  
5. Spread ricotta cheese evenly over the vermicelli.  
6. Layer shredded mozzarella evenly over ricotta.  
7. Cover with remaining vermicelli.  
8. Bake for 30–40 minutes until the top is lightly golden-brown.  

### Meanwhile, prepare the sugar syrup:  
9. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat water over medium heat.  
10. After 2 minutes, add sugar and lemon juice.  
11. Add cinnamon stick or optionally 5 strands of saffron for flavour.  
12. Stir and bring to a boil, then simmer until syrup thickens slightly.  
13. Remove from heat and cool. Remove cinnamon stick. Ensure syrup does not crystallize or harden.  

14. Once vermicelli is baked, remove from oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot vermicelli.  
15. Let cool completely to room temperature.  
16. Loosen edges with a knife and invert onto a serving plate.  

### Garnish  
17. Lightly roast all dried fruits and nuts, chop into small pieces.  
18. Sprinkle the garnish over the kunafa.  
19. Slice into squares and serve.

## Variations

- Boil ½ cup milk with 3 tablespoons semolina and 3 tablespoons sugar until thick. Let cool, then mix with cheese for a smoother filling.  
- Use mawa (khoya) mixed with chenna and sugar as a filling instead of cheese.  
- Substitute cheese with cream (malai).  
- Syrup should be room temperature when poured, never hot or crystallized.  
- Garnish with small mango or banana pieces instead of dried fruits if preferred.
