# Expresso Cookies

I used to get these cookies from Bon Bon Pastry Shop in New Friends Colony, New Delhi and I have loved these since.

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 175°C / 325°F.  
2. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, butter, vanilla, and egg.  
3. Stir in flour, cocoa, and salt until combined into a dough.  
4. Shape dough into small balls using a rounded teaspoon.  
5. Place balls about 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.  
6. Press a thumb or the end of a wooden spoon into the centre of each cookie (not all the way through).  
7. Bake for 10 minutes or until edges are firm.  
8. While still warm, remake indentations if necessary, then transfer to a wire rack and cool for 30 minutes.  

**For the espresso filling:**

1. In a small saucepan, mix cream and coffee.  
2. Heat over medium, stirring constantly until coffee dissolves.  
3. Remove from heat and stir in chocolate until melted and smooth.  
4. Let cool for about 10 minutes.  
5. Spoon about ½ tsp filling into each cookie indentation.  
6. Leave to set for 1 hour.
