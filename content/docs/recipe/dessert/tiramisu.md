## Tiramisu

> This super-simple Italian dessert actually benefits from being made ahead, as this gives it time for all the lovely flavours to mingle.

### Ingredients

- Espresso coffee (strong, cooled to room temperature) – 2–3 cups  
- Eggs (separated) – 2  
- Caster sugar – ¼ cup  
- Mascarpone cheese – 250 g  
- Cream (heavy whipping cream or any cream with more than 36% milkfat) – 1 cup  
- Sponge fingers – 250 g  
- Cocoa powder – for dusting  
- Hazelnuts (roasted and chopped) – for dusting

### Recipe

1. Place the **egg yolks** and **sugar** in a large bowl.  
2. Beat until the mixture turns pale and thick.  
3. Add the **mascarpone** and beat lightly to combine. It's fine if the mixture is slightly marbled.  
4. Whip the **cream** until stiff peaks form, then gently fold into the egg mixture using a spatula or metal spoon — **do not beat**.  
5. In a separate clean metal bowl (ensure no grease or residue), beat the **egg whites** to soft peaks.  
6. Gently fold the egg whites into the cream and mascarpone mixture — again, **do not beat**. Retain as much air as possible.

### Assembling

7. Choose either a large serving dish or individual glasses.  
8. Pour **espresso coffee** into a shallow bowl.  
9. Dip **sponge fingers** into the coffee one at a time — take them out quickly to avoid over-soaking.  
10. Layer the bottom of the dish with the soaked sponge fingers.  
11. Spread half of the **mascarpone mixture** on top and smooth it out.  
12. Add another layer of coffee-dipped sponge fingers.  
13. Finish with the remaining mascarpone mixture, smoothing the surface.

### Finishing

14. Refrigerate **overnight** to allow flavours to develop.  
15. Before serving, dust with **cocoa powder** and sprinkle with **roasted chopped hazelnuts**.  
16. Use a spoon to create a layered effect with the toppings if desired.

**Tip:**  
If using glasses for serving, break the sponge fingers into smaller pieces to fit. Follow the same dipping and layering method. Remember: **do not oversoak** the sponge fingers.
