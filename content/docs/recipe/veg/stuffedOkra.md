- Cumin powder (zeera) – ½ teaspoon

### Method

1. Wash the okra, dry completely, and slit each one vertically without cutting through fully.  
2. Mix all the stuffing ingredients to form a coarse mixture. Gently stuff each okra with the mixture. Keep the remaining mixture aside.  
3. Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a wide skillet. Add mustard seeds and wait for them to pop.  
4. Add the stuffed okra carefully, cover with a lid, and cook on a low flame.  
5. Turn them over gently every 5–10 minutes, ensuring they don’t char or burn.  
6. Once they are nearly cooked and begin to crisp, sprinkle in the remaining stuffing mixture.  
7. Cover again and cook for another 10–15 minutes on low heat.
