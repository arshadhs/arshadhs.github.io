Shahi Paneer is a North Indian dish, a preparation of paneer pieces in a thick, creamy gravy prepared in tomato, onion and cashew-nut paste. Because of its richness, it is usually served at parties, dinners and other occasions which require a special menu.

This is one of the paneer recipes you will find in every dhaba and restaurant, and to me brings back memories of dhaba food from my graduation days.
