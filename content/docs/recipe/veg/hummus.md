## Hummus

I was introduced to hummus by a Mid-eastern friend of mine during my university days, and ever since I have loved it. In *Vegetarian Dishes from the Middle East*, celebrated British Armenian cook Arto der Haroutunian calls hummus, "One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes" and a "must on any mezzeh table."

Hummus can be refrigerated for up to 3 days and frozen for up to one month (just add olive oil if it dries out). It pairs beautifully with bread, olives, and cheese.

**Tip:** Season gradually — the balance of garlic heat and lemon zing should suit your taste. If you love garlic but want to mellow it out, roast or microwave it first to sweeten its bite.

## Method

1. Drain the chickpeas and rinse well. Set aside a few whole chickpeas for garnish.  
2. In a food processor, blend tahini and lemon juice for 30–40 seconds until creamy.  
3. Add chickpeas, garlic, cumin, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Blend to a smooth purée.  
4. Gradually add about ¼ cup of the reserved chickpea liquid while blending, until a soft, creamy paste forms.  
5. Transfer to a serving bowl. Create a shallow well in the centre.  
6. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and garnish with reserved chickpeas.  
7. Sprinkle with paprika or za'tar.
