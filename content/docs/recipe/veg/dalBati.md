**Rajasthani Dal Bati** (दाल बाटी) is a traditional dish from Rajasthan, known for its rustic charm and rich, earthy flavours. It consists of **Dal** (lentil curry) served with **Bati** (baked wheat flour dumplings), often drenched in ghee.

I first tasted it at a Rajasthani friend’s place and have always requested them for it ever since. There are two common variations of *Bati* — one with a filling, and one without. I personally prefer the one with a filling.

*Recipe awaited.*
