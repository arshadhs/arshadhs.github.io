## Spiced Roast Leg of Lamb (Tandoori Raan)

A leg of lamb roast is divine — rich with flavour, tender in texture, and steeped in tradition. The first time I had *tandoori raan* was at Karim’s, during a special dinner to celebrate receiving my first salary. Since then, it's been close to my heart.

For my first home attempt, I used lamb shoulder. My concern was whether the inside would cook thoroughly — it did, beautifully. The key is to **prick the meat generously** so the marinade penetrates deeply, delivering flavour in every bite.

## Method

1. **Prepare the meat**  
   Trim any skin off the lamb leg or shoulder and place it in a large dish. Prick the meat deeply with a fork.

2. **Make the marinade**  
   Blend onion, garlic, ginger, and green chillies.  
   Add yoghurt and blend again.  
   Separately, crush the whole spices (cumin, coriander, 4 cloves, 4 cardamom pods, 1 cinnamon stick, 6 peppercorns, and red chillies).  
   Add to the blender with garam masala, salt, olive oil, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.

3. **Marinate**  
   Rub the marinade all over the meat, ensuring it gets into the pricks.  
   Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.

4. **Roast the lamb**  
   Remove the lamb from the fridge and allow it to come to room temperature.  
   Preheat the oven to 200°C.  
   Line a baking tray with foil, and place the marinated lamb on it.  

5. **Spiced oil drizzle**  
   Heat vegetable oil. Fry the remaining whole spices for a few seconds.  
   Pour the hot spiced oil over the lamb.

6. **Bake**  
   Cover the lamb loosely with foil and roast for **1.5 hours**.  
   Remove the foil, sprinkle paprika or Kashmiri mirch, and add rosemary twigs to the tray.  
   Bake uncovered for a further **45 minutes**, until beautifully browned and tender.

7. **Serve**  
   Slice and serve with plain yoghurt and mint sauce.
