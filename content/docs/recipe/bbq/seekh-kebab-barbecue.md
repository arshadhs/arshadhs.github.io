Seekh Kebab is a classic South Asian barbecue dish made from spiced minced lamb, shaped onto skewers and grilled to perfection. This recipe combines aromatic spices with fresh herbs to create juicy, flavorful kebabs ideal for outdoor grilling or a smoky indoor barbecue.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg lamb mince  
- 1 onion (finely sliced)  
- 3 green chillies (finely sliced)  
- 7 coriander leaves (roughly chopped)  
- 1 tbsp ginger (peeled and finely grated)  
- 5 garlic cloves (peeled and finely grated)  
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds  
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds  
- 1 tbsp black pepper  
- 1 tbsp mustard oil  
- 1Â½ tbsp salt (or to taste)  
- 1 lemon  

## Recipe

1. Two hours before cooking, lightly toast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and black pepper in a dry pan.  
2. Crush the toasted spices using a mortar and pestle.  
3. In a large bowl, combine the lamb mince with onion, green chillies, coriander leaves, ginger, garlic, crushed spices, salt, and mustard oil. Mix thoroughly.  
4. Marinate the mixture for 2 hours in the fridge.  
5. Preheat the barbecue.  
6. Shape the mince mixture into round balls, thread them onto skewers, and flatten around the skewer to form the seekh kebabs.  
7. Grill the kebabs on the barbecue until cooked through and slightly charred.  
8. Remove the kebabs from the skewers and immediately squeeze 3-5 drops of lemon juice on each to enhance the flavor.  

*Note: 1 kg of lamb mince will make approximately 18-20 seekh kebabs.*
