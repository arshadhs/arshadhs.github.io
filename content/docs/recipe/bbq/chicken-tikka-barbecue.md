Chicken Tikka Barbecue is a popular South Asian grilled dish featuring marinated pieces of chicken infused with aromatic spices and yoghurt. This recipe creates tender, juicy chicken with a smoky flavour perfect for outdoor grilling or indoor barbecue.

## Ingredients

- 1 kg chicken (boneless or leg pieces)  
- 2 lemons  
- 1 tbsp ginger (peeled and finely grated)  
- 5 garlic cloves (peeled and finely grated)  
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds  
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds  
- 1 tbsp black pepper  
- 2 tbsp yoghurt or cream  
- 1 tbsp paprika or food colour (optional)  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tbsp salt (or to taste)  

## Recipe

1. Make 2 deep cuts in each piece of chicken.  
2. Squeeze the juice of 1 lemon over the chicken, mix well, and marinate overnight.  
3. Two hours before cooking, lightly toast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and black pepper in a dry pan.  
4. Crush the toasted spices using a mortar and pestle.  
5. Add ginger, garlic, crushed spices, salt, and olive oil to the chicken marinade. Mix thoroughly.  
6. Stir in yoghurt or cream.  
7. Add paprika or food colour if using.  
8. Leave the chicken to marinate for 2 more hours.  
9. Prepare the barbecue or grill.  
10. Thread chicken pieces onto skewers in 3 to 4 pieces per skewer.  
11. Grill over coal, brushing with oil if the chicken looks dry during cooking.  
12. Remove from skewers once cooked through and squeeze 3-5 drops of lemon juice on each piece to enhance flavour.  

*The lemon juice is absorbed better when applied immediately after grilling.*
