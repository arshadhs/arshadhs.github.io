## Paste (Marinade)

- 1 kg **Dahi** (yoghurt, without water)
- 1 tsp **Black Pepper**
- 1 tsp **Chilli Powder**

## Method (Suggested)

1. Mix all the paste ingredients thoroughly to form a smooth marinade.
2. Make deep cuts in the chicken to help it absorb the marinade.
3. Rub the paste generously all over the chicken, ensuring it enters the cuts.
4. Marinate for **6–8 hours**, or preferably overnight in the fridge.
5. Preheat your oven to **200°C / 390°F**.
6. Roast the chicken for **45–60 minutes**, turning once midway, until fully cooked and slightly charred.
7. Rest for 10 minutes before serving.
