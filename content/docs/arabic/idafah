# Iḍāfah (الإضافة) - The Possessive Construction

**الإضافة (Iḍāfah)** means "annexation" or "genitive construction."  
It is used when **two (or more) nouns** are linked together, where the **first noun** is "possessed" and the **second noun** is the "possessor".  
In English, it often translates as **“the ___ of ___”** or with **’s**.  

Example:  
- **كِتَابُ الطَّالِبِ** → *the student's book* / *book of the student*

## Structure  

An Iḍāfah consists of **two parts**:  

| Arabic Term       | Meaning   | Description |
|:-----------------:|:---------:|-------------|
| **المُضَاف**      | Possessed | The first noun (never takes "ال" or tanwīn) |
| **المُضَاف إِلَيْهِ** | Possessor | The second noun (always in the genitive case – مَجْرُور) |

---

## Rules of Iḍāfah  

1. **The first noun (مُضَاف)** cannot take:  
   - **ال (definite article)**  
   - **Tanwīn**  

2. **The second noun (مُضَاف إِلَيْهِ)**:  
   - Is always **genitive (مَجْرُور)**  
   - Can take **ال** or remain indefinite depending on meaning  

3. **Definiteness is determined by the مُضَاف إِلَيْهِ**:  
   - If the second noun has **ال**, the whole phrase is definite.  
   - If the second noun is indefinite, the whole phrase is indefinite.

| Arabic Phrase         | Literal Translation       | Natural English Meaning |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------:|-------------------------|
| **كِتَابُ الطَّالِبِ**  | Book of the student       | The student’s book |
| **بَيْتُ رَجُلٍ**      | House of a man            | A man’s house |
| **مُدَرِّسُ الْمَدْرَسَةِ** | Teacher of the school     | The school’s teacher |
| **مَفَاتِيحُ الْبَيْتِ** | Keys of the house         | The house keys |

## Mnemonic  

Think of Iḍāfah as a **“chain of nouns”**:  

- **First noun** = the *thing being owned* (no الـ, no tanwīn)  
- **Second noun** = the *owner/possessor* (always majrūr, often with الـ)  

- *Ownership is shown by position, not by adding an ’s like in English.*  

---

## Common Uses of Iḍāfah  

- **Possession**: كِتَابُ الطَّالِبِ (*the student’s book*)  
- **Descriptions**: رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ (*a man of truth*)  
- **Time Expressions**: يَوْمُ الجُمُعَةِ (*Friday / the day of Friday*)  
- **Places**: مَدِينَةُ لُندُن (*the city of London*)

## 🆚 Iḍāfah vs. Simple Noun with "ال"  

| Type                     | Arabic Example        | Literal Translation      | Meaning in English |
|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|:------------------------:|--------------------|
| **Iḍāfah (الإضافة)**      | كِتَابُ الطَّالِبِ       | Book of the student      | The student’s book |
| **Simple Noun with "ال"** | الْكِتَابُ الطَّالِبُ يَقْرَؤُهُ | The book – the student is reading it | The student reads the book |

- In **Iḍāfah**, the nouns are joined to show **ownership/relationship**.  
- In a **simple noun phrase with "ال"**, each noun stands alone and does not form a genitive construction.
