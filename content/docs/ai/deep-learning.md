## Deep Learning

- Subset of ML
- focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called **Artificial Neural Networks**.
- A [neural network](/docs/ai/neural-network/) with multiple hidden layers and multiple nodes in each hidden layer is known as a deep learning system or a deep neural network. 
- Allows systems to **automatically learn hierarchical representations** (features) from raw input, such as images, sound, or text.

### Applications

- Computer Vision (e.g., face detection, medical imaging)
- Natural Language Processing (e.g., ChatGPT, translation)
- Self Driving Cars
- Speech Assistants (e.g., Alexa, Siri)
