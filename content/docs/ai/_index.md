- Machine Learning → The broad field where systems learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.
- Neural Networks → A subset of machine learning that uses interconnected artificial neurons to model complex relationships.
- Deep Learning → A subset of neural networks that uses many hidden layers to learn high-level features from large datasets.
- Foundation Models → Large deep learning models trained on massive datasets and reused across many tasks using transfer learning.
- LLMs (Large Language Models) → A specialised type of foundation model focused on understanding and generating human language.
