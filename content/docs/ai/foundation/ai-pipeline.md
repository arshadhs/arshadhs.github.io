# AI Pipeline

The AI pipeline is a continuous process where data is collected, prepared, used to train models, evaluated for performance, and continuously improved after deployment.

{{% steps %}}

1. ## Collect Data

2. ## Prepare data

3. ## Train Model 
	- Iterate until model is good enough
	
4. ## Deploy Model 
	- Get data back
	- Maintain & update model
