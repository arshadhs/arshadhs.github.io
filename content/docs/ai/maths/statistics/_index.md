# Statistical Methods

Statistical methods help you turn **raw data into reliable conclusions**, while understanding **uncertainty, variability, and confidence**.

Statistics provides the **language and tools** for reasoning about data, uncertainty, and inference.

ML needs **understanding data behaviour**, drawing conclusions, and validating machine learning models.

## Role of Statistics in AI and ML

- Helps understand **data distributions**
- Enables **model evaluation**
- Supports **decision-making under uncertainty**
- Forms the basis of **many ML algorithms**

## Core

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Summarises and describes data.

- Mean, median, mode
- Variance and standard deviation
- Histograms and distributions

---

### 2. Probability Distributions
Models how data behaves.

- Normal (Gaussian) distribution
- Binomial and Poisson distributions
- Continuous vs discrete variables

---

### 3. Statistical Inference
Draws conclusions from data samples.

- Sampling techniques
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- p-values

---

### 4. Regression and Correlation
Analyses relationships between variables.

- Linear regression
- Correlation coefficients
- Causation vs correlation

---

### 5. Model Evaluation
Assesses performance and reliability.

- Bias and variance
- Overfitting and underfitting
- Error estimation
