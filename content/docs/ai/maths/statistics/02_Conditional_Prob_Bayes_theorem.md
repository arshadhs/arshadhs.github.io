# Conditional Probability & Bayes theorem

## Conditional Probability

- probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
- a measure that quantifies how the likelihood of an event changes when we have additional information about another related event.

## Bayes' Theorem

- extends the idea of conditional probability. 
- provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
