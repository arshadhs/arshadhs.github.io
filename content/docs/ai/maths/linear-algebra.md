# Linear Algebra

## What to learn

- Scalars, vectors, matrices

- Vector operations (add, dot product)

- Matrix multiplication (very important)

- Identity & transpose

- Eigenvalues & eigenvectors (conceptual)

---

## Why first?

- Every ML model uses matrices

- Neural networks are just matrix pipelines

---

## Outcome

You can look at a model and say:

“This is transforming vectors using matrices.”
