# Linear Systems

How systems of linear equations are represented and solved using matrices.

- Linear systems describe multiple linear equations solved simultaneously.
- They connect algebraic equations with matrix representations.

## Machine Learning View

Many machine learning models can be abstracted as:

{{< katex display=true >}}
y = Wx + b
{{< /katex >}}

x → input data, 
W → weight, how model transforms it, 
𝑏 → bias adjusts the result
y → is the output.

> **Models transform input vectors using matrices.**
