# Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra forms the foundation for representing data and transformations in machine learning.

Linear Algebra provides the mathematical language used to represent data, transformations, and structure in machine learning.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters in ML

- Every machine learning model uses matrices
- All data in ML is represented using **vectors and matrices**
- Neural networks are pipelines of matrix operations
- Models apply **matrix transformations** to data
- Optimisation relies on linear algebra operations

## What to Learn

- Scalars, vectors, and matrices  
- Vector operations (addition, dot product)  
- Matrix multiplication *(critical)*  
- Identity matrices and transpose  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors *(conceptual understanding)*  
---
- **Scalar** → a number
- **Vector** → a directed point  
- **Matrix** → a space transformer  
- **Linear transformation** → structured mapping  
- **Feature** → one axis  
- **Feature space** → where data lives  
- **Vector space** → where vectors live

## Machine Learning View

Many machine learning models can be abstracted as:

{{< katex display=true >}}
y = Wx + b
{{< /katex >}}

> **Models transform input vectors using matrices.**
