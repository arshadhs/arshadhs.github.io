# Linear Algebra

The **study of vectors and matrices** is called Linear Algebra.

Linear Algebra provides the **mathematical language** used **to represent data, transformations, and structure** in ML.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters in ML

- Every machine learning model uses matrices
- All data in ML is represented using **vectors and matrices**
- Neural networks are pipelines of matrix operations
- Models apply **matrix transformations** to data
- Optimisation relies on linear algebra operations

## What to Learn

- Scalars, vectors, and matrices  
- Vector operations (addition, dot product)  
- Matrix multiplication *(critical)*  
- Identity matrices and transpose  
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors *(conceptual understanding)*  
---
- **Scalar** → a number
- **Vector** → a directed point  
- **Matrix** → a space transformer  
- **Linear transformation** → structured mapping  
- **Feature** → one axis  
- **Feature space** → where data lives  
- **Vector space** → where vectors live
