# Determinant and Trace

## Determinant

Determinants tell us whether a matrix is invertible and enable the computation of eigenvalues, which are fundamental to PCA and dimensionality reduction in machine learning.

- Indicates invertibility
- Relates to volume scaling

## Trace
- Sum of diagonal entries
- Appears in many ML objectives
