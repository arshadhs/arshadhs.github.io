# Matrix Decompositions

Decompositions reveal structure in matrices and power algorithms like PCA.

Matrix decompositions break complex matrices into simpler parts.

## Common Decompositions
- Eigen-decomposition  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)  
- Cholesky decomposition

## Machine Learning Perspective

Matrix decompositions help:
- Reduce dimensionality
- Improve numerical stability
- Extract structure from data
