# Norm

A **norm** measures the length (magnitude) of a vector.

- the norm of a vector x measures the distance from the origin to the point x.

Common example: Euclidean norm.

\lVert \mathbf{x} \rVert_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \cdots + x_n^2}

## Common norms
- L1
- L2
- Infinity norm

## Why it matters
- norms quantify size
- are used in distances and regularisation.
