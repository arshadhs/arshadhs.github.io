# Linear Independence

A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if none of them can be written as a linear combination of the others.

{{< katex display=true >}}
c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \cdots + c_k\mathbf{v}_k = \mathbf{0}
\;\Rightarrow\;
c_1=\cdots=c_k=0
{{< /katex >}}

Independence means each vector adds **new information**.

## Why it matters
- Detects redundancy
- Connects to rank and basis
