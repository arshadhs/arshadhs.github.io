# Lengths and Distances

The **length** of a vector is given by its norm.

The **distance** between two points (vectors) is the norm of their difference.

Distance quantifies **how far two vectors (data points) are** from each other.

d(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y} \rVert

## Why it matters
- many ML algorithms depend on distances in feature space
