# Semi-Supervised Learning
- A combination of **labelled** and **unlabelled data**.  
- Useful when labelling large datasets is **expensive or time-consuming**.  
- Works well with **high-volume datasets** (e.g. millions of images).  
- Only a **small fraction of data** is labelled (e.g. a few thousand).  
- The algorithm learns from both labelled examples and structure in unlabelled data.  
- **Ideal for medical imaging** where labelled data is limited.  
- For example, a **radiologist** can label a small set of medical scans,  
  and the model uses that to learn from thousands of unlabelled scans.  
- Helps improve **accuracy and generalisation** with minimal manual effort.
