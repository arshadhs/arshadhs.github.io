# Linear Neural Networks for Classification

- Single neuron for classification - which category  
- Data, linear model with single neuron, sigmoid activation function,  and binary cross entropy loss for single neuron for classification (no hidden layers) 
- Training using stochastic gradient descent algorithm 
- Prediction or inference  
- Eg: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) (UCI) prediction with a single neuron - code implementation from scratch (webinar) 
- Multi-class classification - which category  
- Data, linear model with multiple output neuron, softmax activation function,  and cross entropy loss for multiple neurons for classification  (no hidden layers) 
- Training using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent algorithm 
- Prediction or inference  
- Eg: Iris (UCI) prediction with a multiple neuron - code implementation from scratch (webinar)
