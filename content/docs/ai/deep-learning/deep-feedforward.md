# Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (DFNN) or Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for Classification

- MLP as solution for XOR  
- Hidden layers and Non-linearity 
- Forward Propagation (use vectorization and algorithm for forward pass) 
- Define loss functions and compute the error 
- Backward Propagation (use vectorization and algorithm for backprop) 
- Weight updation using gradients  (use vectorization and algorithm for backprop) 
- Impact of depth and width in DFNN 
- Code implementation from scratch (webinar)
