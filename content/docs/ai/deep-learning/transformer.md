# Transformer

- is an architecture of neural networks 
- based on the multi-head attention mechanism
- text is converted to numerical representations called tokens, and each token is converted into a vector via lookup from a word embedding table
- takes a text sequence as input and produces another text sequence as output

- foundation for modern **[Large Language Models (LLMs)](/docs/ai/genai/llm/)** like ChatGPT and Gemini
