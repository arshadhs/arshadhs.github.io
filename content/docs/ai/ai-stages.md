# AI Development Stages: ANI → AGI → ASI

Artificial Intelligence is often described in **three stages**, based on capability and scope:

- **ANI:** Task-specific intelligence (today’s AI)
- **AGI:** Human-level general intelligence (future goal)
- **ASI:** Beyond human intelligence (theoretical)

## ANI — Artificial Narrow Intelligence
- also called **Weak AI**
- designed to perform **one specific task**
- Operates within a **predefined environment**
- Cannot generalise beyond its training
- **Most AI systems today are ANI**

**examples**
- Spam email filters
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Face recognition systems
- Recommendation engines (YouTube, Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud detection in banking

### Generative AI (GAI)
- A **subset of ANI**
- Built using **deep learning models**
- Creates **new content** instead of just predictions
- Learns patterns from vast datasets

**examples**
- ChatGPT (text)
- DALL·E / Midjourney (images)
- Music and video generation tools

## AGI — Artificial General Intelligence
- also called **Strong AI**
- **Human-level intelligence** across many domains
- can learn, reason, and adapt to **new tasks** without retraining
- can transfer knowledge from one domain to another
- does **not currently exist** in reality
- current AI That Hints at AGI (but isn't): GPT-4/LLMs, DeepMind's Gato, Self-Driving Cars/AlphaGo

**examples**
- An AI that can learn medicine, law, and engineering like a human
- A robot that can reason, plan, learn new skills, and adapt to new environments
- A system that understands context, emotions, and abstract concepts

---

## ASI — Artificial Superintelligence
- represents a **hypothetical future**
- Intelligence that **surpasses human intelligence** in most or all domains
- capable of rapid self-improvement
- extremely high impact on science, society, and humanity
- raises serious **ethical, safety, and control concerns**
