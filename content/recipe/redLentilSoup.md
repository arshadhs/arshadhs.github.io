This is one of my favourite vegetarian soup since I had it when I visited **Sultanahmet Koftecisi** in Istanbul. I still dream about this place. I was in Istanbul for holidays and on the recommendation from friends decided to stay in Sultanahmet, close to Aya Sofia and Blue Mosque. We went to 'Sultanahmet Koftecisi' after reading a recommendation on Lonely Planet, this very well-known restaurant and it was very crowded but so worth it. The kofte (or "meatballs") are amazing and the stuff that dreams are made of.

I had obscene amounts of delicious food in Istanbul (one of the factors contributing to it being my new favourite city in the world) and this place still stands out.

**Sultanahmet Koftecisi** do an equally good *Çorbası* (soup) for a starter.
