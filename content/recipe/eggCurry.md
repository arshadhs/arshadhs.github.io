### Recipe

1. Wash and chop the tomatoes; set aside.  
2. Peel, wash, and chop the onions; set aside.  
3. Peel potatoes, wash, and cut in halves roughly the size of the eggs.  
4. Boil 8 eggs for 20 minutes. After boiling, discard the hot water, replace with cold water, peel eggs, and keep ready.  
5. Pierce each egg with a fork — this helps the masala penetrate the egg.  

6. Heat oil in a kadai (wok). When hot, add peeled boiled eggs carefully (avoid water to prevent splatter).  
7. Fry eggs gently, moving them for 30–40 seconds to avoid sticking, until lightly or crispily golden as preferred.  
8. Optionally, fry potatoes in the same oil.  
9. Add turmeric powder to give eggs a golden yellow colour. Once fried, remove eggs and keep aside.  

10. In a pressure cooker, heat oil and add chopped onions.  
11. Spread onions evenly and wait for 1 minute without stirring (to avoid onion smell).  
12. Then stir periodically to cook all sides evenly until yellow.  

13. Make space in the center of the onions; add more oil if needed and heat it.  
14. Add ½ tsp chilli powder, ½ tsp turmeric powder, and 2 tsp coriander powder.  
15. When the masala becomes shiny and oil starts separating, add whole spices: cumin seeds, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamoms. Fry for 20 seconds.  
16. Add ginger garlic paste and fry for another 20 seconds until aromatic.  
17. Increase heat and add chopped tomatoes, green chilli, and 1½ tsp salt.  
18. Cook until tomatoes soften slightly.  

19. Add potatoes, close the cooker lid, and cook for 1 whistle.  
20. Once pressure releases and cooker cools, open and add the fried eggs.  
21. Add ½ tsp garam masala powder and ½ tsp cumin powder.  
22. Cook for 1–2 minutes to blend flavours.  
23. Garnish with chopped fresh coriander leaves.
