## Recipe

1. Whisk the flour, baking soda, cornflour, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.  
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until smooth and lump-free.  
3. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk, then add the vanilla extract.  
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix with a spatula. The dough will be soft, thick, and slightly greasy.  
5. Fold in the chocolate chips. They may not stick easily due to the melted butter, but mix as well as you can.  
6. Cover the dough tightly with cling film and refrigerate for at least 2–3 hours or up to 3 days.  
7. Let the dough soften at room temperature for 10 minutes before baking.  
8. Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F). Line baking trays with parchment paper.  
9. Shape the dough into tall balls (like small cylinders) to ensure thick cookies. Place 8–9 per tray.  
10. Bake for 12–13 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned and centres are soft.  
11. Cool on the tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.  

**Storage:**  
Cookies stay fresh in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
