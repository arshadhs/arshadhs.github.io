One of the best lamb stew recipes I've tried — courtesy of my dear cousin **Khushi**, who learnt it from her mum. I bargained this recipe from her in return for sharing a barbecue recipe!

## Recipe

1. Heat oil in a pressure cooker.  
2. Add 2 sliced onions and the whole spices (cardamoms, cloves, pepper, mace, bay leaves).  
3. Once onions turn golden brown, add the lamb and fry until the water dries out.  
4. Add salt and ginger garlic paste — **achhe se bhuno** (sauté really well).  
5. Add remaining 2 onions, tomato, fennel, coriander powder, green chillies and dry red chillies.  
6. Add red chilli powder if you like it spicy.  
7. Add 1 cup of water and pressure cook until the lamb is tender.  
8. Once pressure is released, **bhuno** (sauté again) to thicken the gravy.  
9. Finish by adding garam masala and chopped green coriander.
