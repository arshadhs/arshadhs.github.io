99% of what I see is forgotten. 99% of what I think remains locked inside me. 99% of my words are lost within a short while of them being spoken. "Silence is Golden" but there may be a few of those words that are worth sharing. Recipes jotted down but incomplete; they could just be useful to someone. A thought - a trigger - a reminder. So I'm going to post them here. Hey - I might look back and they might be useful to me at some time!

There is something very special about this dish, I ate it almost 4 days a week around 2007-2008. I was on a strict diet plan, one that I made for myself. And I made it a point that there was as less fat as possible, and I get enough proteins and vitamins. It was a plan to lose weight and still get a diet which I can burn during my morning run and evening gym session.

This was the time I did not know how to cook chicken and slowly started working out on the recipe, improving it and adding removing bits I did not like. It is like many other recipes but one which was my own innovation. I did things I liked and it was an absolute hit.

*PS: For variations, replace curd with tomato puree / sarso ka saag/spinach etc.*
*Also, at times I had use Shana masala instead of ground spices.*
*Add 2-3 green chilies if you like them (reduce the quantity of red chili and garam masala if doing so).*
*Garnish with green coriander.*
