Welcome to my little corner of the web.

A lifelong learner, builder, and someone who enjoys making sense of complex things.

This space is a home for my thoughts-in-progress: whether it’s something I’m building, a topic I’m digging into, or an idea I haven’t quite figured out yet. I believe in learning out loud and sharing what I discover along the way.

I spend my time coding / reading / teaching tech / tinkering and exploring ideas.

I am a seasoned Techie with a passion to learn new skills both technical and [non-technical](https://500px.com/p/ArshadSiddiqui)!

Here you'll find snapshots of ideas I’m exploring, side projects I’m tinkering with, and topics that keep me curious. Some things are still rough around the edges—and that’s exactly how I like it.
