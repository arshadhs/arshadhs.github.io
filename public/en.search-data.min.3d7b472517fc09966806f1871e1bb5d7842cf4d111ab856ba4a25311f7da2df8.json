Prepare the Rice # Wash rice several times to remove starch. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes. After soaking, drain and mix rice with: 7-spice blend Maqluba spices Salt Set aside. 2. Cook the Chicken # Heat oil in a large pot. Add onion halves and sauté. Add chicken pieces. Add maqluba spices, whole garlic, black pepper, cinnamon stick, coriander (if using), and cardamom. Add enough water to cover the chicken. Simmer for 20–30 minutes until fully cooked. Remove chicken and strain the broth. Optionally: crisp up the chicken in the oven or air fryer. Assembly # Cut parchment paper to fit the bottom of your pot. Lay tomato slices over the paper. Layer in this order: Chicken Potato slices (if using) Rice Pour hot broth over the rice (not warm or cold). Add: Fried pine nuts and almonds A spoonful of ghee Cover with a lid and boil on medium-high. Once boiling, reduce heat and cook until rice is fluffy (15–25 minutes). To Flip Maqluba # Let it rest for at least 10 minutes before flipping. Place a large plate over the pot. Flip confidently and serve! Notes # Parchment paper prevents sticking and makes flipping easier. Taste your broth before adding to rice — if salty, replace 2 cups with plain water.

Each vendor often has their own unique recipe, which can include dozens of spices\nOn my trip to Morocco, I bought Ras el Hanout spice mix — I\u0026rsquo;d heard quite a lot about it, but buying it in Marrakech had its own charm.

After giving a few to friends and leaving some in the hen run for the chickens to feed on, I was still left with a good number.\nThat’s when I had a spark — Pumpkin Casserole!\nI realised the pumpkin itself could be used as a casserole dish — bake it inside the pumpkin, stuffed with meat. Voila!\nIt’s a hollowed-out pumpkin, filled with spiced meat and roasted whole. Since pumpkins come in unpredictable shapes and sizes, the baking time really depends on how long it takes for the pumpkin to get soft enough to pierce with a knife — so being precise is almost impossible.\nI chose a small one from the allotment and gave it a go.\n📝 Ingredients # 1 medium-sized pumpkin Salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste) 2–3 garlic cloves ½ kg boneless lamb or beef 2 onions 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste Whole spices (black pepper, green and black cardamom, cloves, bay leaf, cinnamon) Chilli flakes (to taste) 2 tbsp oil (for rubbing the pumpkin) 👩‍🍳 Recipe # Prepare the meat:\nHeat oil in a pressure cooker. Add whole spices and sliced onions. Add meat, salt, and ginger garlic paste. Fry well. Close the cooker lid and pressure cook until the meat is slightly cooked. Set aside. Prepare the pumpkin:\nPreheat oven to 180°C (fan). Cut the top off the pumpkin (as a lid). Scoop out seeds and stringy pith using a metal spoon. Rub the inside and outside of the pumpkin with oil. Season generously with salt and pepper. Stuff and bake:\nFill the pumpkin with the partially cooked meat, garlic cloves, and chilli flakes. Close with the pumpkin lid and place on a baking tray. Bake for 1 hour, then check for softness by piercing the skin. Continue baking for another 30 minutes if needed, until the pumpkin is soft and meat fully cooked. 🍴 Serving Tip # Cut the pumpkin into wedges and serve warm, with the meat spilling out from inside.

Out of all most hyped Biryani, there are two competing Biryani in India: Lucknow, and Hyderabad.\nThe hype is orchestrated to promote various restaurants. Lucknow is a grand old city once ruled by Nawabs and capital of Uttar Pradesh; while, Hyderabad is a grand old city once ruled by Nizams and joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This has become a friendly food fight between North and South over Biryani. After all, all the tastes are acquired. North Indians like Lucknow Biryani, and South Indians like Hyderabad Biryani. The hype has created a natural curiosity over the differences.\nPeople can get into arguments over which city makes the best biryani, and then over which restaurant in that city makes the best biryani.\nBiryani or Pulao? # And then there are arguments about calling our\u0026rsquo;s as \u0026ldquo;Biryani\u0026rdquo; and and other\u0026rsquo;s as \u0026ldquo;Pulao\u0026rdquo;, depending on which one you prefer. Lucknow’s biryani is also often – unfairly I think – referred to as pulao since the meat and rice are cooked separately and then layered together at the end. That’s only semantics. Wheras Hyderabadi biryani is what Lakhnawis call pulao or tehri. Lakhnawis cook the yakhni separately and then layer it in a degchi with rice and put on dum. Whereas in Hyderabadi biryani, everything is cooked together like pulao or tehri in Lucknow.\nHyderabad Biryani # This is called Kutchi Biryani. Kutchi means raw.\nThe process does not adhere to the name Biryani in Farsi meaning \u0026lsquo;fry before cooking\u0026rsquo;. Neither the meat, nor the rice are fried before cooking.\nThe meat is marinated in a mixture of spices for a few hours. Meat and the meat marinate are put in Handi. The rice is mixed with spiced yogurt. The \u0026lsquo;rice and yogurt mixture\u0026rsquo; is put on top of the meat. The Handi is sealed and cooked over low heat. Eventually, the meat and rice are Dum cooked. The result is very different than Lucknow Biryani. The Lucknow Biryani has a homogenous meat flavor throughout the Biryani; while, the Rice in Hyderabad Biryani has more of a yogurt flavor than the meat flavor. In theory, Hyderabad Biryani is simple to make, but requires a lot of experience.\nLucknow Biryani # Lucknow Biryani is also called Awadh Biryani. Lucknow Biryani is a form of Pukki Biryani.\nPukki means \u0026lsquo;cooked\u0026rsquo;. Both the meat and rice are cooked separately and then layered and baked. The process also lives up to the name Biryani in Farsi meaning \u0026lsquo;fry before cooking\u0026rsquo;.\nIt basically has three steps:\nFirst, the meat is seared in ghee and cooked in water with warm aromatic spices till meat is tender. The meat broth is drained out. Second, the rice is lightly fried in Ghee, and cooked in the meat broth from the previous step. Third, cooked meat and cooked rice are layered in a Handi. Sweet flavors are added. The Handi is sealed and cooked over low heat. The result is a perfectly cooked meat, rice, and a homogenous flavor of aromatic meat broth, aromatic spices and sweet flavors.\nKolkata Biryani # There is a third kind of Biryani called Kolkata biryani, which is a version of the Lucknow one.\nThe biryani in Kolkata is known for its subtle use of spices, fragrance and delicious potato, which is almost as tasty as the chunk of mutton in the rice. It was brought to the erstwhile Calcutta by Lucknow’s ruler, Wajid Ali Shah, the last nawab of Oudh. When he was exiled to Calcutta, he brought his personal chefs with him. Potatoes were used in the biryani instead of meat during the recession, which later became a special feature of the Kolkata style biryani.\nThe variables are complicated such as amounts, moisture of yogurt mixture and marinate, and cut of meats. All the variables have to be carefully balanced so everything will cook together and come out perfectly.\nAs for India’s best city for biryani? # Well, that depends on where you come from.\n"},{"id":64,"href":"/docs/recipe/rice/yakhnibiryani/","title":"Yakhni Biryani","section":"Rice","content":"Wednesday, 4 June 2014\nYakhni Biryani\n“Yakhni” means broth or stock.

If you love garlic but want to mellow it out, roast or microwave it first to sweeten its bite.\nIngredients # Chickpeas – 200 g (canned, drained and rinsed – reserve some liquid) Tahini (sesame seed paste) – 1½ tablespoons Garlic cloves – 2, crushed (or more to taste) Lemon juice – 2 tablespoons (adjust to taste) Ground cumin – ½ teaspoon (optional) Extra virgin olive oil – 2 tablespoons Salt – ½ teaspoon Paprika or za\u0026rsquo;tar – 1 teaspoon (optional, for garnish) Method # Drain the chickpeas and rinse well. Set aside a few whole chickpeas for garnish. In a food processor, blend tahini and lemon juice for 30–40 seconds until creamy. Add chickpeas, garlic, cumin, salt, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Blend to a smooth purée. Gradually add about ¼ cup of the reserved chickpea liquid while blending, until a soft, creamy paste forms. Transfer to a serving bowl. Create a shallow well in the centre. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and garnish with reserved chickpeas. Sprinkle with paprika or za\u0026rsquo;tar. Variations # Want to switch things up? Try adding one of the following before blending:\nA few sun-dried tomatoes 2 green chillies A handful of fresh coriander or mint leaves Enjoy hummus as a dip, a sandwich spread, or part of a mezzeh platter — it\u0026rsquo;s healthy, delicious, and always a hit!\n"},{"id":67,"href":"/docs/recipe/cake/chickentikkamasala/","title":"Chicken Tikka Masala","section":"Cake","content":"Bold, creamy, and smoky – this Chicken Tikka Masala combines marinated grilled chicken with a rich spiced sauce that’s perfect for a weekend feast or a showstopping dinner.\nChicken Tikka Masala # Chicken tikka masala stimulates the senses; the mildly spiced masala coating tender pieces of marinated, char-grilled chicken is one of Britain’s favourite takeaways.\nAlthough it is claimed the dish was created in Glasgow, it certainly has Indian influences. There is no standard recipe for chicken tikka masala; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken. I found Madhur Jaffrey’s Curry Nation to be the most interesting for my taste buds. Her recipe of marinating chicken in whipping cream ends up flawlessly moist, thanks to her grilling technique. No one can beat Jaffrey’s DIY answer to the fiery tandoor—it gives the chicken an intense charcoal flavour.\nThe Marinade # Ingredients # Chicken – 500 g boneless, skinless thighs or breasts, cut into 2.5 cm chunks The marinade:\nLemon juice – 3 tablespoons Salt – ½ teaspoon Ginger – 1 tablespoon, peeled and finely grated Garlic cloves – 2, finely grated Ground cumin – 1 teaspoon Paprika – 1 teaspoon Turmeric – 2 teaspoons Garam masala – ½ teaspoon Dried red chillies – 2, crushed Cardamom pods – 10 Whipping cream – 6 tablespoons Sunflower oil – 3 tablespoons Method # Rub the chicken with salt and lemon juice. Leave for 20 minutes. Add the remaining marinade ingredients, mix well, cover, and refrigerate overnight. The Masala # Ingredients # White onion – 1, finely sliced Garlic cloves – 5, finely sliced Ginger – 1 tablespoon, finely grated Sunflower oil – 5 tablespoons Cumin seeds – 1 teaspoon Coriander seeds – 1 teaspoon Dried red chillies – 3, crushed Paprika – 2 teaspoons Turmeric – ½ teaspoon Yogurt – 4 tablespoons Tomatoes – 3, finely chopped Tomato purée – 1 tablespoon Ground almonds – 1 tablespoon Chicken stock – 350 ml Single cream – 120 ml Garam masala – ¼ teaspoon Coriander leaves – 4 tablespoons, fresh and chopped Method # Grind cumin, coriander, and chillies in a pestle and mortar. Heat oil in a large non-stick pan. Add onion and fry until caramelised (6–8 minutes). Add garlic and ginger, cook for another 2–3 minutes. Add spice mix (paprika, turmeric, ground cumin/coriander/chillies). Stir for 10 seconds. Add yogurt, one tablespoon at a time, stirring until absorbed. Add tomatoes and cook until pulpy. Stir in tomato purée, almonds, and chicken stock. Cover and simmer for 15–20 minutes until thickened. Stir in cream just before serving. Cooking the Chicken # Preheat grill to highest setting. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers. Suspend skewers over a dish/tray and grill 5 minutes each side until charred and cooked through. Alternatively, place oiled chicken on a baking tray and grill 5 minutes per side. Tip: Cut into the thickest piece to ensure it’s fully cooked — no pink should remain.\nFinish the Dish # Reheat the sauce and gently fold in the grilled chicken pieces. Garnish with garam masala and fresh coriander leaves. Serve with naan, steamed basmati rice, or chapatis — and enjoy a taste of Britain’s most beloved curry classic!\n"},{"id":68,"href":"/docs/recipe/cake/chickenchickpeas/","title":"Chicken Chickpeas Curry (Murgh Cholay)","section":"Cake","content":"A comforting, hearty dish where tender chicken meets the earthiness of chickpeas, Murgh Cholay is a flavour-packed curry perfect for a cosy dinner or weekend treat.\nIngredients # Main: # Chicken – 1 whole (about 1 kg) Onion – 3 medium, roughly chopped Garlic (grated) – 4 cloves Ginger (grated) – 2 tablespoons Green chilli – 3 (sliced vertically, halved horizontally) Tomato – 5 medium, chopped Chickpeas – 1 kg (soaked and boiled, or canned) Salt – to taste Vegetable oil – 5 tablespoons Whole Spices: # Bay leaf (Tez Patta) – 2 Cinnamon (Dalchini) – 1 stick Black cardamom (Badi Elaichi) – 2 Cloves (Laung) – 3 Black pepper (Kali Mirch) – 5 Nutmeg (Jaiphal) – 3 pinches Mace (Javitri) – 1 strand Ground Spices: # Turmeric powder – 1 teaspoon Chickpea spice mix (Choley Masala) – 2 tablespoons Recipe # Heat oil in a non-stick pot.

With the sharp dip in temperatures, Harissa becomes the most sought-after delicacy during winters in Srinagar.\nHistory # It is said that the concept of Harissa was brought to Kashmir by Mirza Hyder Duglat of Yarkand during the Chak period in 1540.\nSome historians trace its origins to Central Asia, which greatly influenced Kashmiri art, custom, rituals, belief, and cuisine — blessing the region with this flavoursome delight.\nIts roots also stretch back to the Mughal era. During Afghan rule in Kashmir, Harissa was formally introduced in its present form.\nBack then, economic conditions were so dire that many substituted boiled turnips — a cheaper alternative — for Harissa.\nEventually, shops opened in Aali Kadal and Saraf Kadal in Shahar-e-Khaas, with the former becoming particularly famous for adding milk to the dish.\nHarissa slowly became a cherished cultural food, often gifted to celebrate snowfall predictions!\nIngredients # Lamb (cut into very small pieces) – 1 kg Garlic – 4 cloves Onions (roughly chopped) – 2 medium Dried ginger powder (shounth) – 1 tablespoon Salt – to taste Water – 1 litre Whole Spices (to be tied in a muslin cloth) # Cinnamon sticks (daalchini) – 2 Brown cardamom (badi elaichi) – 4 Green cardamom (choti elaichi) – 8 Cloves (laung) – 4 Peppercorns (kali mirch) – 8 Fennel seeds (saunf) – ½ cup Other # Rice flour – ½ cup Cold water – 1 cup (for paste) Oil – 1½ cups Shallots (praan) – 4 (for garnish) Method # In a pressure cooker, add the lamb, garlic, onion, ginger powder, salt, and water. Place all whole spices in a muslin cloth and tie to form a potli. Add this potli to the cooker. Cook on medium-high heat. After 2 whistles, reduce heat and let simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Turn off heat and let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid, stir with a wooden spoon until the meat and onions have blended into a uniform mixture. Remove any bones and discard the spice potli. To thicken: # Mix rice flour with cold water to form a smooth paste. Return the cooker to the stove and stir in the rice paste. Add oil gradually and keep stirring every 2 minutes over medium-high heat. Continue until the mixture thickens and oil begins to leave the sides (this may take another 45 minutes to 1 hour). Garnish # Slice shallots thinly and fry in hot oil until golden and crispy.\nBe careful not to burn or break them. Serve the Harissa hot, topped with crunchy fried shallots and the oil. Traditionally served with Kashmiri bread. Note:\nCut the meat very small so it requires less stirring. When reheating, if the Harissa has thickened too much, stir in a few tablespoons of milk to loosen the texture.

Add chopped coriander leaves, garam masala and cumin powder. Let the daal simmer for 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and cover. Variations # For Split Red Gram (Arhar daal): Do not add chana daal while soaking. You may also add tomato to the spice paste or tamarind paste while simmering. For Chana daal: Add a clove, black cardamom and a bay leaf to the oil, along with brown mustard seeds. Add tamarind or amchoor paste when simmering. For Moong daal chilka: Add garlic to the spice paste, and when frying whole spices, use only cumin seeds (omit mustard seeds, curry leaves, and asafoetida).

Like that half-written recipe or a fleeting idea. Maybe it’ll help someone out there. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;ll help me when I stumble across it again.\nSo here’s one of those recipes. A bit of a throwback to 2007–2008, when I was on a strict self-designed diet. I’d eat this dish about four times a week. It was clean, protein-packed, low-fat, and gave me just enough energy for my early morning runs and evening gym sessions.\nBack then, I barely knew how to cook chicken. So I experimented—trial and error, tweaks and retweaks—until this recipe came to life. It\u0026rsquo;s not revolutionary, but it\u0026rsquo;s mine. Familiar, yet personal. Simple, yet satisfying.\nIngredients # 1 kg chicken breast (or a whole chicken, if you prefer) ½ kg onions 5 cloves garlic (grated) 2 tbsp fresh ginger (grated) 400 g plain curd (yoghurt) Salt to taste 5 tbsp olive oil (or sunflower/vegetable oil) Whole Spices\n2 bay leaves 1 stick cinnamon 4 green cardamoms 3 black cardamoms 4 cloves 6 black peppercorns 3 pinches nutmeg 2 strands mace Ground Spices\n1 tsp red chilli powder 2 tsp coriander powder ⅔ tsp garam masala ½ tsp turmeric powder Method # Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pot. (Don’t overheat it—olive oil prefers it gentle.) Add the whole spices and let them release their aroma. Add chicken, ginger, garlic, and salt. Sauté until the chicken turns white on all sides. Remove the chicken and set aside. Remove the whole spices from the oil and keep them aside too. Add the ground spices and curd to the chicken, and let it marinate for at least an hour. Meanwhile, in the same pot, fry the onions until golden. Add the whole spices back in. Top up the oil if needed. Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat with the lid on for 15–20 minutes, or until done. PS\nFor a twist, try using tomato purée, sarson ka saag (mustard greens), or spinach instead of curd. Sometimes I’d cheat and use Shana masala—nothing wrong with shortcuts. Want it spicy? Toss in 2–3 green chillies and dial down the red chilli and garam masala to balance. Garnish with fresh green coriander and serve it up hot. This one’s close to my heart. Hope it finds a place in your kitchen too.\n"}]
