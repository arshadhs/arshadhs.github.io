Most of what I think never makes it out of my head.<br>
Most of what I say disappears into the air not long after I say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence is golden&rdquo;—but sometimes, a few of those thoughts or words might be worth capturing. Like that half-written recipe or a fleeting idea. Maybe it’ll help someone out there. Maybe it&rsquo;ll help me when I stumble across it again.</p>
<p>So here’s one of those recipes. A bit of a throwback to 2007–2008, when I was on a strict self-designed diet. I’d eat this dish about four times a week. It was clean, protein-packed, low-fat, and gave me just enough energy for my early morning runs and evening gym sessions.</p>
<p>Back then, I barely knew how to cook chicken. So I experimented—trial and error, tweaks and retweaks—until this recipe came to life. It&rsquo;s not revolutionary, but it&rsquo;s mine. Familiar, yet personal. Simple, yet satisfying.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 kg chicken breast (or a whole chicken, if you prefer)</li>
<li>½ kg onions</li>
<li>5 cloves garlic (grated)</li>
<li>2 tbsp fresh ginger (grated)</li>
<li>400 g plain curd (yoghurt)</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>5 tbsp olive oil (or sunflower/vegetable oil)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Whole Spices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 bay leaves</li>
<li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
<li>4 green cardamoms</li>
<li>3 black cardamoms</li>
<li>4 cloves</li>
<li>6 black peppercorns</li>
<li>3 pinches nutmeg</li>
<li>2 strands mace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ground Spices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 tsp red chilli powder</li>
<li>2 tsp coriander powder</li>
<li>⅔ tsp garam masala</li>
<li>½ tsp turmeric powder</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a non-stick pot. <em>(Don’t overheat it—olive oil prefers it gentle.)</em></li>
<li>Add the whole spices and let them release their aroma.</li>
<li>Add chicken, ginger, garlic, and salt. Sauté until the chicken turns white on all sides.</li>
<li>Remove the chicken and set aside.</li>
<li>Remove the whole spices from the oil and keep them aside too.</li>
<li>Add the ground spices and curd to the chicken, and let it marinate for at least an hour.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in the same pot, fry the onions until golden.</li>
<li>Add the whole spices back in. Top up the oil if needed.</li>
<li>Add the marinated chicken and cook on medium heat with the lid on for 15–20 minutes, or until done.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><strong>PS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For a twist, try using tomato purée, <em>sarson ka saag</em> (mustard greens), or spinach instead of curd.</li>
<li>Sometimes I’d cheat and use <em>Shana</em> masala—nothing wrong with shortcuts.</li>
<li>Want it spicy? Toss in 2–3 green chillies and dial down the red chilli and garam masala to balance.</li>
<li>Garnish with fresh green coriander and serve it up hot.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This one’s close to my heart. Hope it finds a place in your kitchen too.</p>
