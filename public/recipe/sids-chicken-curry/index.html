Hey - I might look back and they might be useful to me at some time!</p>
<p>There is something very special about this dish, I ate it almost 4 days a week around 2007-2008. I was on a strict diet plan, one that I made for myself. And I made it a point that there was as less fat as possible, and I get enough proteins and vitamins. It was a plan to lose weight and still get a diet which I can burn during my morning run and evening gym session.</p>
<p>This was the time I did not know how to cook chicken and slowly started working out on the recipe, improving it and adding removing bits I did not like. It is like many other recipes but one which was my own innovation. I did things I liked and it was an absolute hit.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chicken Breast - 1 kg (or a full chicken)</li>
<li>Onion - 1/2 kg</li>
<li>Garlic (grated) - 5 cloves</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Whole Spices</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bay Leaf (tez patta) - 2</li>
<li>Cinnamon (dalchini) -1 stick</li>
<li>Green Cardamom (chotti elaychi) - 4</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Red Chilli powder - 1 teaspoon</li>
<li>Coriander powder - 2 teaspoon</li>
<li>Garam Masala - 2/3 teaspoon</li>
<li>Turmeric powder - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat olive oil in a non-stick pot (remember you cannot overheat olive oil)</li>

<li>Add chicken, ginger and garlic, salt and fry it, keep turning till all sides get white</li>
<li>Remove chicken and keep in a bowl</li>
<li>Remove spices from oil and keep in a separate bowl</li>
<li>Add ground spices to chicken, add curd, leave it to marinate for about an hour or more</li>
<li>Heat oil and fry the onions add the whole spices (which we had removed before from oil), add oil if there is not enough oil in the pot.</li>
<li>Add marinated chicken to the pot</li>
<li>Cover the pot and cook it on medium heat until the chicken is done (usually 15-20 minutes)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>PS: For variations, replace curd with tomato puree / sarso ka saag/spinach etc.</em>
<em>Also, at times I had use Shana masala instead of ground spices.</em>
<em>Add 2-3 green chilies if you like them (reduce the quantity of red chili and garam masala if doing so).</em>
<em>Garnish with green coriander.</em></p>
