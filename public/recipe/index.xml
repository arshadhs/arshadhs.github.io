      <description>99% of what I see is forgotten. 99% of what I think remains locked inside me. 99% of my words are lost within a short while of them being spoken. &amp;ldquo;Silence is Golden&amp;rdquo; but there may be a few of those words that are worth sharing. Recipes jotted down but incomplete; they could just be useful to someone. A thought - a trigger - a reminder. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to post them here.</description>
